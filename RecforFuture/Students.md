# Recommendations for Future Students.

1. At the Very beginning of the class, record all the due dates of assignments, both team and indiviual. This course is requires good work mangement skills, especially time. If you have a hiccup on at least one assignment, your goig to fall back very far in the course if you can't recover properly.

2. Understand what your designing and building. When introduced to the project it's best to know what components are required for each design you brainstorm. If these components are already known for you and you know how to program them, it's best to work with what your comfortable with.

3. The peralta labs are very limited for designs. When you get to that point of the project, cross reference your padsize and spacing to confirm if peralta lab can design it. Definitly save the specific specs to your book marks so you can easily reference them when designing both subsystem boards and team boards.
