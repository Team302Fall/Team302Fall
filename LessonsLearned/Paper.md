# Lessons Learned

When it comes to the comes to the lessons learned from this project, one of the many lessons to take from this is understanding how your component works. When it came down to the components used for this project out team made the mistake of overlooking not only the command fuction of the components, but also the pad placement of them as well. One member used a component that had pins of the components that were to close, causing the footprint of the component to have continuity errors during the building process of the board. Another component that ran into a problem was one that originally we thought was a I2C component, but later found out that the component was a MSSP programming component. Another lesson to Walk away with is understanding your other team members components. Even though each member is assigned to one subsystem, it does hurt to understand each others subsystems. This would allow each member to review each others work and make edits to the design if necessary. I also learned the importance of understanding each team member's components to avoid potential issues if someone needs to leave the group. Regarding coding, I realized that every MCU has its own set of functions and tools, which require specific knowledgeâ€”something I had to learn the hard way. Additionally, I discovered the value of using plenty of flux during the soldering process. Flux significantly improves the chances of avoiding shorts when adding components to the PCB and also makes it much easier to remove already soldered components if needed.
