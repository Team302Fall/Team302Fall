# Hardware Implementation
![image 1](FinalSchematic.PNG)

The Hardware implementation is a culmiation of the teams components on one singular board. The main goal of this product is to monitor both tempurature and humidity, based on the monitored variables, use a fan to adjust the tempurature. The Schematic is design to allow easy guidance, from the top right of it showing the power and regulator schematic's, to the subsystems other members designed.  

to help guide what connected to what, the main board designer used net labels for a organized deisgn and easy to follow wire tracing. The schematics design was kept in the mind of the consumer in hopes for easy understanding and guidence for them. This of course can also be used for the manufacturer's so they can easily identify where their specific components belong.

When it comes to the steps of Hardware implementation, if there were a version 2.0, The components would be more organized to allow easy identification for placement. The final had many capacitors on it and some subsystems required different valued components besides a 0.1uF bypass capacitor. The new version would have some text added to the board to help identify what capacitor is what. Another issue involving the capacitors and the resistors was that some of the components we ordered were much smaller than we anticipated, as a result, some of the pads on the board were also small. This made problems for the team member who was assembling the board. Using a tool that has references for pad sizes. The 2.0 version will have easy to solder pads that will allow the team member assembling the board not to have issues placing the components. Overall, the 2.0 version of the board would need more time to review pad size of components and micro components, Notation to identify said components, and better organization of the board.
