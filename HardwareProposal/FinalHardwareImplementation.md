# Hardware Implementation
![image 1](TEAMSchematicV4-1.png)

The Hardware proposal is a large schematic of each team members subsystem schematics. With some help and Guidence, the team schematic is designed so we can read it with power starting at the very top right corner, to the bottom and side with each members subsystem labeled. When it comes to connections, we used a lot of Net labels to help organize each members layout and visually. It's with in our best interest to have the have the schematic easy to read and understand for both ourselves and our customers.
